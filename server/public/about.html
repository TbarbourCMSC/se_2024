            Semester Long Team Project (50%): Students get to choose their own project
            which should be an end to end web application. The students should choose a
            project which satisfies the following requirements: 
            <br>
            1. Your application should have a database designed appropriately.
            <br>
            2. Your application should have a presentable User Interface (UI).
            <br>
            3. Your application should be able to perform CRUD operations from
            your database by making Application Programming Interface (API)
            calls which means that your application must be able to make API
            calls from your user interface to get the data from a source( ex:
            database).
            <br>
            4. Your application should be thoroughly tested (ex: Integration
            Testing, Functional testing).
            <br>
            5. Your application should be hosted online. It should be noted that local hosting is acceptable.
